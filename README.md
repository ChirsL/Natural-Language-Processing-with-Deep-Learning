# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning
This is me trying to learn NLP in-depth, by watching online lectures from Stanford University School of Engineering as well as reading an online text called Hands on Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow. I will be updating notes as well as mini projects to document my learning.
